# This is my project after the beginer modul in Kotlin

### Hi there, my name is Mirel and this is my first project in Kotlin

## Is a little game in which I used all the principles I learned during the module: "basics of programming-kotlin" with Syntax Institute

### I used 
- OOP principals like:
    - Inheritance
    - Encapsulation
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstraction
- "for" , "while" - loops
- "if", "else", "when" - conditionals and so more...
### The Game has the following things:
- A "Hero" super Class wich from inherits all the hero-types(Elemental, Ranger....)
- A "Opponent" super Class, from wich inherits the "Enemy" class
- A "Team" Class in wich you can choose 3 heroes for your battle
- and a playGame file where are defined 2 functions: 
  -     "playgame"- where is defined how a complet game will act
  -     "oneRoundFight"- where a round of the game is defined

##### This isn`t his last form, because I want to implement more actions and possibilities with time.
#### You can feel free to copy/clone the game, make some improvements if you want and try it on.
